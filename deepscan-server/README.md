# VS Code DeepScan - server part

The server part of the VS Code DeepScan extension.

DeepScan is a JavaScript code inspection tool that helps you to find problems in your code.

**Note:**

To use this extension, you should confirm that your code is transferred to the DeepScan server for inspection when you save your changes.

You can confirm it by pressing the Confirm button that appears when you re-start VS Code after the installation.

Note that your code is completely deleted from the server right after the inspection.
