# VS Code DeepScan - server part

The server part of the VS Code DeepScan extension.

DeepScan is a cutting-edge JavaScript code inspection tool that helps you to find bugs and quality issues more precisely by data-flow analysis. You can also use it for React because DeepScan delivers [React specific rules](https://deepscan.io/docs/rules/#react).

> **Note:**
> To use this extension, you should confirm that your code is transferred to the DeepScan server for inspection when you save your changes.
> You can confirm it by pressing the Confirm button that appears when restarting VS Code after the installation.
>
> Note that your code is completely deleted from the server right after the inspection.
